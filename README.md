Project Alias is a open-source parasite to train custom wake-up names for smart home devices while disturbing the their build in microphone. This node app is a sound classifier running on a raspberry pi zero and can be trained from a web-app.


# Setup üîß
How to prepare and setup a raspberry pi zero for this project. 

1. Download the latest version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and flash your micro SD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)

2. Copy the **ssh** and **wpa_supplicant.conf** files to the SD card (boot) 

3. Edit the **wpa_supplicant.conf** to match your wifi settings. Insert the card to the raspberry pi

4. In terminal ssh into the pi: ```sudo ssh pi@raspberrypi.local```<br>*Defult password is 'raspberry'. To change password use the 'passwd' command*

5. Update your pi: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```

6. Install **nodejs** : ```sudo apt-get install nodejs npm git-core```

# Installing 

Clone and install sound driver for the [ReSpeaker](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/) hat and reboot. 

```
cd && git clone https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard && sudo ./install.sh
```

Install the **Alias** project: 

```
npm i project_alias
```
Setup a bootscript: 

# Use Alias üçÑ

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

Open a browser on your phone and go to ```raspberrypi.local:8000```
