Project Alias is an open-source parasite to train custom wake-up names for smart home devices while disturbing their build in microphone.  

*NOTE: this project is still experimental and in development.*

## Hardware requirements

- [Raspberry Pi A+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus/)
- [ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/)
- [Tiny speakers](http://www.visaton.de/en/products/miniature-speakers/k-16-50-ohm)



## Raspberry Pi Setup üîß

How to prepare and setup a Raspberry Pi for this project:

1. Download the latest version of [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and flash your micro SD card with [Etcher](https://etcher.io/)

2. Copy the **ssh** and **wpa_supplicant.conf** files from the [setup folder](setup/) to the SD card (boot) 

3. Edit the **wpa_supplicant.conf** in a text editor to match your wifi settings. Insert the card to the raspberry pi

4. In terminal ssh into the pi: ```sudo ssh pi@raspberrypi.local```<br>*Defult password is 'raspberry'. To change password use the 'passwd' command*

5. Update the pi: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```<br>

7. Reboot ```sudo reboot```


## Installing 


On the Rapsberry Pi: clone and install the sound driver for the [ReSpeaker](http://wiki.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker_2_Mics_Pi_HAT/) hat:<br>
*This is only required when using the ReSpeaker hat, this code will also work with other sound drivers.*

```
cd && git clone https://github.com/respeaker/seeed-voicecard.git
cd seeed-voicecard && sudo ./install.sh
```

Install **Tensorflow** and **Keras**:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-dev python3-pip git libatlas-base-dev 
sudo pip3 install tensorflow keras 
```

Install the requred modules: 

```
sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-spidev python-h5py
sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio libsdl-ttf2.0-0 python3-pygame 
sudo pip3 install flask flask_socketio python_speech_features
```

Clone the **Alias** project: 

```
git clone https://github.com/bjoernkarmann/project_alias.git
```

Setup a bootscript. Open this file:

```
sudo nano /etc/rc.local
```
 and add at the end of the command just before **exit 0**, like:
  
```
cd project_alias && python3 app.py &
```
Now reboot the Pi to test it:

```
sudo reboot
```
## Training Alias üçÑ



1. To train Alias use the browser on your phone and open ```raspberrypi.local:5050```

2. Hold down the record button while saying the new name about 4-6 times. A small bar should indicate the 2 seconds recording window. Each name should fit within this timeframe.

3. Under the menu, click **Train Alias** and wait a few seconds for the model to learn the name. This name does not necessarily need to be a word but can be a sound and any language. So be creative! You can always reset your name on the menu. *Tip: it helps to record the name from different locations in your home.*

4. Try it out! Say the name and ask your question once you see a blue light on the device or on your phone. 
Note: once trained there is no need to have the phone connected anymore. 

*If you find Alias is not responding correctly, try to train a few more examples. Or if you find Alias is triggering to often, you can go to the menu and turn background sound ON. This toggles the background mode and adds any new recordings to the background examples. Record and train just as before, but try to capture unique sounds in your environment or even words that sound similar to your chosen name.*
