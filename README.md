2. Copy the **ssh** and **wpa_supplicant.conf** files from the [setup folder](setup/) to the SD card (boot) 

3. Edit the **wpa_supplicant.conf** in a text editor to match your wifi settings. Insert the card to the raspberry pi

4. In terminal ssh into the pi: ```sudo ssh pi@raspberrypi.local```<br>*Defult password is 'raspberry'. To change password use the 'passwd' command*

5. Update the pi: ```sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade```<br>

7. Reboot ```sudo reboot```
